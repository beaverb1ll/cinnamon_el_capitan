# cinnamon_el_capitan
Theme for GTK3 that feels like OS X El Capitan

This is a collection of themes that some what work together as a wanna be
OS X (macOS) theme. Currently the only shell theme that is being worked on is
Cinnamon, however gtk-3 and the various icons are still being worked on.

This is an attempt to make Linux feel and look somewhat like a Mac while using
Linux on a Mac.
